## Our story

PathOnAI was founded in **2024** by a group of AI researchers and engineers passionate about making advanced AI agent technology accessible to everyone.

We collaborate with academic institutions, industry partners, and individual contributors worldwide—building open-source AI agent frameworks that are powerful, practical, and easy to use.

---

## Research areas

### 1) AI Agents (Web Agents / Multi-Agent Systems)
We build open-source systems and research to improve how agents **reason, search, and act**, along with tooling that makes agent behavior **interpretable** and **debuggable**.

### 2) Robotics & Embodied AI
We focus on open-source embodied AI research with **low-cost robots** (e.g., SO-ARM100/101, LeKiwi), lowering the barrier for beginners and hobbyists to get started.

---

## Featured project

### VisualTreeSearch — Understanding Web Agent Test-time Scaling
An intuitive, fully deployed system for visualizing and understanding web-agent tree search at test time, including:

- Production-ready deployed system
- Fast API-based state reset (50s → 2s)
- Interactive visualization UI for agent decision-making
